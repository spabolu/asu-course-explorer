# ASU Course Explorer ðŸ”±
High-Performance API for ASU Course Catalog written in Go.

### About The Project
Arizona State University doesn't have an openly available API to access their course catalog. As it stands, students must navigate through the university's [website](https://catalog.apps.asu.edu/catalog/courses/courselist) to find this information, which is often buried in several layers of webpages.
`ASU Course Explorer` aims to solve the missing piece to the problem. 

Built this as a fun side project and a heavily-modified production version written in TypeScript is what's running the backend for [Courseer](https://courseer.co/)!
Feel free to implement this project into your personal open-source projects!

### Built With
- [Go](https://go.dev/) - Programming Language
- [Rod](https://github.com/go-rod/rod) - Driver for DevTools Protocol
- [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) - Web Framework
- [Redis](https://github.com/redis/go-redis) - In-Memory Data Structure Store (for caching)

### Get Started

```shell
cd asu-course-explorer/

# Install dependencies
